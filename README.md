# Savig - Note-taking and task management website
# Introduction
Do you think a person can truly remember everything? Have you ever felt that all of your appointments and tasks are in order? 
To address these issues, the most effective and common approach is to take notes and organize tasks for all of your work. 
Note-taking and task management offer us a variety of benefits, from the retention of essential information to the effective management of time. 
Moreover, it not only helps in summarizing and storing the information we need to remember, but it also contributes to saving our time and effort.

This is the reason why we decided to create Savig - a note-taking and task management website. And this is our [demo](https://savig-project-sbsk.vercel.app/auth/login).
